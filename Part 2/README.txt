1.ANLY 501 Project2 Report.pdf:  Project 2 report2.There are 3 foldersFolder EDA 1: statisticalAnalysis and data insight, histograms and correlationsFolder EDA 2: cluster analysis and associationFolder PredictiveAnalysis: Hypothesis testingFolder EDA 1:ANLY501Project2Part.py: codes for  statisticalAnalysis and data insight, histograms and correlationsmyspotify_v2 is the cleaned dataset from project 1.Folder EDA 2:mySpotify_v3.csv is the cleaned dataset that includes the binning variablesCluster.py is the code for clustering analysisAssociation.py is the code for association rule analysisANLY501Project2Part2.py is the execution file for part2. Please just run the ANLY501Project2Part2.py file.Folder PredictiveAnalysis:1.Project2Part3codes : all the codes for part3, there are 5 files for each classification methods. Only need execute ANLY501Project2Part3.py to get everything run. There is a csv which is the cleaned dataset from project 1.2.DecisionTreeGraph: all decision trees for 29 genres.This codes will produce a series gv file(like party graph.gv) which are the decision tree graphs. To convert gv to .png, install graphviz, input$dot -Tpng party graph.gv -o party graph.png   on terminal. 3.classification.txt: confusion matrix and classification results reports for 29 genres data.4.ROCCurve: roc plots for 29 genres5.Precision_test.csv and precision_train.csv: summary of all classification methods on 29 genres datasets.PS: 2-5 will all be produced by 1.
